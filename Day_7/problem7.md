# Day 7: Arrays

## Objective 
Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given an array, **_A_**, of **_N_** integers, print **_A_**'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **_N_** (the size of our array). 

The second line contains **_N_** space-separated integers describing array **_A_**'s elements.

## Constraints

- **1 <=** **_N_** **<= 1000**
- **1 <=** **_A<sub>i</sub>_** **<= 10000**, where **_A<sub>i</sub>_** is the **_i<sup>th</sup>_** integer in the array.
Output Format

Print the elements of array **_A_** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Sample Input

```bash
4
1 4 3 2
```

## Sample Output

```bash
2 3 4 1
```
