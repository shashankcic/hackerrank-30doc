# Day 10: Binary Numbers

## Objective 
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given a base-**10** integer, **_n_**, convert it to binary (base-**2**). Then find and print the base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in **_n_**'s binary representation.

## Input Format

A single integer, **_n_**.

## Constraints
- **1 <= _n_ <= 10<sup>6</sup>**

## Output Format

Print a single base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of **_n_**.

## Sample Input 1

```bash
5
```

## Sample Output 1

```bash
1
```

## Sample Input 2

```bash
13
```

## Sample Output 2

```bash
2
```

## Explanation

Sample Case 1: 

The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.


Sample Case 2: 

The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
